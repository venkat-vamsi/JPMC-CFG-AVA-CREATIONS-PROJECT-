1. # PROJECT DETAILS: ONE PERSON GO TO A TRIBE AND COLLECTS DATA ABOUT THE MEMBERS (DATA LIKE NAME , PHONE , FAMILY DETAILS , ASSETS) AND THESE TRIBE PEOPLE ARE WORKING IN DIFFERENT PROFESSIONS INCLUDING HANDLOOM , SERICULTURE, BAMBOO , AGROPRODUCTS, AND THEY ARE INCLUDED IN MANUFACTURING OF PRODUCTS FROM VARIOUS PROFESSION LISTED ABOVE , AND EACH PRODUCT DETAILS INCLUDES NAME, STORY OF PRODUCT, PRICE, DESCRIPTION , AND FOR PROFESSION (DETAILS SHOULD BE NAME , CLIMATE_CHANGE_FACTORS_IMPACT, SOIL_TYPE,ETC U SUGGEST FCATORS THAT CAN BE ADDED FOR THOSE RESPECTIVE PROFESSIONS) AND USING THOSE FACTORS OF EACH PROFESSION INTEGRATED WITH EACH PRODUCT , ALERTS ARE SENT TO A GROUP OF CO WORKERS WORKING ON SAME PROFESSION IN SAME LOCATION WHERE ALERT IS NEEDED ( EXAMPLE , TEMPERATION IS INCRESED FOR THIS SERNICULTURE PROFESSION , SO THIS ALERT IS TO ALL WORKERS OF GROUP WORKING ON THAT PROFESSION, BECAUSE ALL PEOPLE IN A GROUP ARE IN SAME LOCATION) , WE ARE WORKING ON SPRINGBOOT AND MONGODB , GIVE SAMPLE JSON OF ENTIRE PROJECT , MAKE IT SCALABLE 

**How it helped:**
- Provided a comprehensive, real-world scenario for the backend design, ensuring the system supports complex relationships between tribe members, professions, products, and alerts.
- Helped identify the need for scalable, modular data models (for members, professions, products, alerts, etc.) and integration of environmental/profession factors.
- Guided the creation of alerting logic and group-based notifications, making the system more useful and actionable for end users.
- Ensured the backend is extensible for future requirements, such as new professions, additional product attributes, or more complex alerting rules.

# Project Prompts and How They Helped

1. **Build and enhance a Spring Boot backend for an artisan/marketplace platform with MongoDB, supporting modules for users, products, orders, complaints, feedback, government schemes, and role-based/JWT security. Implement REST APIs for CRUD operations, search, and business logic, and provide example JSON and deployment guidance.**
   - *How it helped:*
     - Set the foundation for the backend architecture, ensuring all modules and business requirements were covered.
     - Guided the creation of models, repositories, services, and controllers for each module.

2. **Remove the razorpay part for now, just create endpoints to addOrder and to findAllOrders and also find Orders by the name of a user**
   - *How it helped:*
     - Simplified the order service and controller, focusing on core CRUD and search functionality without payment integration.

3. **Give an endpoint for creating an order**
   - *How it helped:*
     - Ensured the API had a clear POST endpoint for order creation, making it easy for clients to add new orders.

4. **Give a few example jsons for these orders with different statuses**
   - *How it helped:*
     - Provided ready-to-use sample payloads for testing and documentation, improving API usability.

5. **Follow the order.java for the schema and give json**
   - *How it helped:*
     - Ensured that all example JSONs matched the actual data model, reducing confusion and integration errors.

6. **Give the name in the pathVariable**
   - *How it helped:*
     - Improved the REST API design by using path variables for user-specific queries, making endpoints more intuitive.

7. **For userfeedback, give an api endpoint to get all the feedback**
   - *How it helped:*
     - Added a GET endpoint for feedback, enabling clients to retrieve all user feedback easily.

8. **Give example feedback json**
   - *How it helped:*
     - Provided sample feedback payloads for testing and documentation.

9. **Follow the UserFeedback.java model**
   - *How it helped:*
     - Ensured feedback examples and endpoints were consistent with the actual model.

10. **Servlet.service() for servlet [dispatcherServlet] in context with path [] threw exception [Request processing failed: org.springframework.dao.IncorrectResultSizeDataAccessException: Query { "$java" : Query: { "phone" : "9908342934"}, Fields: {}, Sort: {} } returned non unique result]**
    - *How it helped:*
      - Identified a data integrity issue and prompted a discussion on enforcing uniqueness or handling multiple results, improving backend robustness.

11. **Okay create a word file with all the prompts that i gave in this chat and explain how it helped me**
    - *How it helped:*
      - Summarized the development process and decisions, providing clear documentation for future reference or team sharing.
